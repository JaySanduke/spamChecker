## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>  # NA
cd spamChecker
go mod tidy
```

### 2. Create .env file

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgresSpamChecker
DB_NAME=spamChecker
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=SpamCheckerSuperSecret
```

### 3. Run the app

Prerequisites:

- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Golang 1.24^**

### To run the app in development mode:

Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose -f 'docker-compose.yml' up -d --build 'db' 
```

or you can run any other postgres database instance but just change the UserName, Password and the Host in the env file.

Then, run the following command to start the application:

```
go run cmd/main.go --mode=development
```

### To run the app in production mode:

You can run the following command to start application in production mode using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

or if you want to run the app without docker, you can run the following command:

```
go run cmd/main.go --mode=production
```

### 4. Seed Sample Data (optional)

To populate the database with sample data, run the following command if the application is running locally:

```
go run scripts/seed.go
```

or if you are using docker, run the following command:

```
docker exec -it spamChecker_app go run scripts/seed.go
```
